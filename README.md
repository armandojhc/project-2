# Project 2 - Triolingo

## Description
Triolingo is an easy to use introdunctional language learning app that allows you to learn quick, easy, and most importantly useful! This 1.0 version translates English to Spanish phrases but we hope to introduce more laguages in the new future. 

## Objective:
We wanted to create a simplified learning platform that categoriezes for you ten phrases to learn in a new language. Travel, work, food, social and "yo mamma's jokes". This app is NOT designed to learn a full language end to end. Its meant for you to learn quick and easy phrases that you can use every day. This app simplifies phrase learning by using a known and simple learning tool, note cards!

 We utilizes BcryptJS, Express,  Passport, Node.js and JavaScript as primary packages and tools. This app uses Sequelize, routes and models to communicate with a MySql data base. In addition we used html , css, and JavaScript to built a concise working application that utilizes Bootstrap framework to complement the styling of the overall project.

User Walkthrough
When the user navigates to the site he/she will land in the splash page where they have the option to sign in or register a user account. If user decides to register, they will be taken to the register page where they can enter their email and password to register to the site. If the user already has a registered account , they will be able to sign-in using the email and password.

When login in the user lands in the application dashboard which has five categories of phrase "lessons' that they can work on at their on pace. Each of these lessons have ten phrases English phrases and their corresponding translated Spanish sentence that appear in note cards and that the user is able to flip back and forward. The app is designed so that the user is able to flip back and forward each phrase and navigate to the next phrase using the navigation arrows that appear at the button of each note card. On the right side of the screen the user will see the navigation bar where they can navigate to other lessons, back to the dashboard or logout of the app. Each page in the app has a logout button at the top. The app also tracks the progress of the user . If the user decides to log out and continue later, when they log back in they can pick up where they left off as each lesson has a phrase tracker that logs the progress of each user.
